## Mod 8 - Deploying Applications

### 8.1 - 12-Factor App Methodology

eveolved from the cloud/PaaS deployments.

<https://12factor.net> - Heroku

Codebase - One code base, saved in VCS (version control sys) - ideally same repo
multiple ENVs, testing, staging, prod....

Dependencies - explicitly declare and isolate dependencies, i.e python local ENV, Conntainers..

Configuration - never part of the src code, instead use ENV vars, watch out for security as others might be able to see them,  supply the runtime info with orchatration.

Backing services - treat backing services as attached resources, easy to replace and move

Stages -  strictly seperate build, run stages.

Processes - execute the app as one or more stateless process,

Port Binding - seperate apps so that they can run anywhere on the network.

Concurrency - scale out via the process model,

Disposability - fast startup and graceful shutdown, faststart containers, fronted by LB,

Dev/Prod - keep dev, stage and prod as similar as possible.

logs - send logs outside of the app to someother entity.

admin process - admin/mgmt tasks as oneoff processess.

### 8.2 - Containerize Applications using Docker

minikube

this is extra

` some code here `

```python

## Mod 9 - Understanding Distributed Systems

- when writing a new application, where might performance issues arise as you scale?
- At what threshold do the benifits of a distributed system outweigh the challenges?

### 9.2 - Distributed Application Concepts

monolith - spof
three tier - layer architecture for, use dns or lb to distribue. flexible and convenient for development and scaling.

HAProxy software lb - l4 or l7 LB, frontend(VIP listner), backend(pool of servers)
could also use NGINX from F5 to do similar tasks.

What is the advantage of application-layer load balancers?
They can load-balance traffic based on the request resource.

### 9.3 Custom Dashboard Example

- frontend - HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, .NET, react.js, Angular, and similar frameworks whose goal is to present the data to the user in a structured, understandable way, aiming for the best user experience.

- backend - PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, .NET, and so on. The back-end sets the default behavior of the application state. It defines rules what can be done on the state and how the front end can interact with the core of the application.

sample script to interact with Cisco DNA

```python
import requests

base_url = 'https://<IP or hostname>'
r = requests.post(f'{base_url}/dna/system/api/v1/auth/token',
                         auth=('<USERNAME>', '<PASSWORD>'))
r.raise_for_status()
token = r.json()['Token']

headers = {'X-Auth-Token': token}
r = requests.get(f'{base_url}/dna/intent/api/v1/site-health', headers=headers)
r.raise_for_status()
sites = r.json()['response']
```

### 9.4 Event-Driven Architecture Concepts

flow of information is determined by the stream of events
Events are significant state changes inside a system.
Events do not travel outside the system, event notifications (or messages) do.

The EDA architecture can be implemented with two different types of topologies.

The mediator topology is used when there is a need for you to orchestrate several event steps through a central mediator, and the broker topology is better suited for chaining events together without a central mediator. It is important for you to know the differences between these two topologies in order to understand which one is better for your situation.

The architecture is comprised of three components:

- Event Emitter: Event emitters gather the state changes required for an event to happen within a system and send them to the event channel.

- Event Channel: Event channel is used to forward the events to an event consumer. It can also do some preprocessing of the events before they are sent. Event channels often include messaging queues, to distribute messages horizontally or to prevent the channel from being overwhelmed.

- Event Consumer: Event consumers are components that can perform a specific task, based on the event that is processed.

### 9.5 Microservice Architecture Concepts

Q. How can you efficiently scale an application when designing with microservices architecture?

A. An individual service can be deployed to a new machine, preferably in a **container**, and a **load balancer** needs to be configured for traffic balancing.

### 9.6 Effective Distributed Application Logging Strategies

The goal of distributed logging is to give you one place where you can find all the logs.

Q. Which process or property of the data is the most important for effective distributed logging?
A. data aggregation

### 9.7 Using Distributed Logging to Diagnose Problems

The primary concept of distributed tracing is to label the log when a request first appears in the system. As the request makes its journey, each log entry contains the same label that was assigned at the source of the request. This label indicates an activity that the system performs on each request. By using the label and the time stamp, you can quickly analyze the path or the activity that was performed on each request over multiple microservices.

OpenTracing and OpenCensus distributed tracing frameworks are now merged into a single project called OpenTelemetry, which is meant to replace both projects in the future.

Q. How can you achieve distributed tracing?
A. Assign the label when the request enters the system.

### 9.8 Diagnose Problems Using Application Logs

LAB

- Graylog server
- login admin/admin
- In the navigation bar, choose the System tab and then the Inputs option.

### 9.9 Application Monitoring with Cisco AppDynamics

As instrumentation code can observe the communication of application code with other systems, Cisco AppDynamics is able to create a map of application components and graphically represent how they communicateâ€”an application topology, if you will.

Q. Which two types of monitoring agents are supported by Cisco AppDynamics? (Choose two.)
A. Machine
A. Application Server

### 9.10 Limitations of Distributed Systems and CAP Theorem

Networking Pitfalls

- Consistency: Responses provide up-to-date data or no data at all.

- Availability: Responses always provide data, even if it is not up-to-date.

- Partition tolerance: System continues operation in face of network failure.

Q. What does the CAP theorem state about a distributed system?
A. A system can be available and consistent if there are no network partitions.

### 9.11 Overcoming Challenges in Distributed Systems

Bulkhead pattern,
Circuit Breaker pattern,
